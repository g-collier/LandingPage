# LandingPage

This was a weird twist on [The Odin Project's - Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) - project. 

The goal was to practice some basic HTML/CSS concepts by mimicking the layout using Flexbox.

Overall it was a lot of fun and helped get me out of relying on position: too much.

I decided to omit the "Call to action - sign up" entry above the footer because i'd already included a sign up in the header as well as I felt ending the page off with a fast and furious quote would be really funny.


If there's any hiring managers reading this, i'm sorry about the whole Vin Diesel thing.
