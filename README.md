# LandingPage

This was a weird twist on [The Odin Project's - Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) - project. 

The goal was to practice some basic HTML/CSS concepts by mimicing the layout using Flexbox.

Attached is a pic of the layout reference provided.

If there's any hiring managers reading this, i'm sorry about the whole Vin Diesel thing.
